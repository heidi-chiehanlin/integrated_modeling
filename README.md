# integrated_modeling
An integrated program that covers pre-modeling analysis, data preprocessing, modeling to model selection.

Several advantages of this program:
- The preprocessing tools are flexible to apply at anytime in preprocessing process. For instance, *XYAnalyzer* can be used before and after preprocessing to observe linear relationship bwtween each X and y.
- The *Modeler* saves not only clf and parameters, but also model performance and data profile to support further model validation and analysis.
- The *ModelerCollector* saves multiple modelers, perform model selection and comparisons.
